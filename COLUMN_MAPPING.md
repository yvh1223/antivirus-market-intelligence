bulk_ai_processor_enhanced.py
↓ Populates:
• sentiment_score, sentiment_label
• confidence_score, key_topics
• issues_mentioned, priority_level  
• processed_at, ai_model_used
```

### **STAGE 3: Analysis & Reporting**
```
Business Intelligence Queries
• Competitive analysis

## 🎯 **KEY INSIGHTS**

### **Initial Load (Collection Phase):**
- ✅ Focuses on **raw review data** and metadata
- ✅ Links reviews to **products and platforms**
- ✅ Preserves **original review information**
- ❌ **No analysis or interpretation** yet

### **AI Processing Phase:**
- ✅ Analyzes the **`content` field** with GPT-4o-mini
- ✅ Extracts **structured insights** from unstructured text
- ✅ Adds **business intelligence** metadata
- ✅ Maintains **processing audit trail**

### **Data Quality Gates:**
- **Initial**: Must have `content`, `rating`, `product_id`
- **AI Ready**: `processed_at` IS NULL (unprocessed reviews)
- **AI Complete**: All AI columns populated + `processed_at` timestamp
- **Analysis Ready**: `confidence_score` > threshold for reliable insights

## 📋 **VERIFICATION QUERIES**

### **Check Initial Data Quality:**
```sql
-- Reviews ready for AI processing
SELECT COUNT(*) as ai_ready_reviews
FROM reviews 
WHERE content IS NOT NULL 
AND content != ''
AND processed_at IS NULL;
```

### **Check AI Processing Completeness:**
```sql
-- AI processing quality check
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_processed,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN sentiment_score IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as has_sentiment,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN key_topics != '[]' THEN 1 END) as has_topics,
    AVG(confidence_score) as avg_confidence
FROM reviews 
WHERE processed_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Current Processing Status:**
Based on your latest verification:
- ✅ **1,000+ reviews processed** with AI
- ✅ **100% completeness rate** (all have sentiment scores)
- ✅ **0.832 average confidence** (excellent quality)
- ✅ **Real AI analysis** (not default values)
